            <h4>2: Hermes</h4>
            <p>
              Hermes is the god of messengers and travelers — and since the Internet is a messenger, he is also regarded as the Internet's god.
              We placed him on tile 2 because he is of the youngest Olympians and we felt we should pay homage to the Web with him as the first picture you see.

            <h4>4: Hephaestus</h4>
            <p>
              Hephaestus is the god of fire and smiths.
              He is often represented with the anvil.
              He takes tile 4 because even though he is important, he does not control an enormous domain of Greek mythology.
              Interestingly, Hephaestus had the nickname "Ἀμφιγύεις" which means "the lame one".

            <h4>16: Heracles</h4>
            <p>
              Heracles started as a mortal in Greece. He was the strongest man in the world.
              Hera hated him all his life because Zeus and another women, Alcmene, bore him.
              To show her hatred, she made Heracles insane — and he ate all of his children.
              To make up for his sins, he was forced to complete twelve famous labors.
              Heracles take tile 16 because he was not originally an Olympian, yet he is not of no importance.

            <h4>32: Persephone</h4>
            <p>
              Persephone is the goddess of nature.
              Hades, madly in love, kidnapped her to become queen of the underworld.
              Her yearly trip to the underworld lasts 6 months in which all beauty disappears and the bitter cold of winter replaces it — but upon return, beauty is restored.
              Persephone takes tile 32 because she is not that important yet isn't nobody.

            <h4>64: Aphrodite</h4>
            <p>
             Aphrodite is the goddess of love.
             Aphrodite is often represented with a dove or swan.
             Greeks believed love to be bad as it draws away people from importance to the need to fulfill desire.
             Aphrodite takes tile 64 because she was very important to the Greek belief.

            <h4>128: Hades</h4>
            <p>
              Hades is the god of the underworld.
              He is one of the more important gods — he controls the fate of every mortal's dead soul.
              He is represented by Cerberus, a vicious multi-headed dog.
              Hades takes tile 128 because he has quite an important role in Greek mythology, but many gods are more important than him.

            <h4>256: Athena</h4>
            <p>Athena is the goddess of wisdom and civilization. Athena was awkwardly born out of Zeus' head because Zeus swallowed Metis, Athena's mother. Zeus experienced massive headaches until one of the gods cleaved his head and Athena popped right out. The city Athens is dedicated to her, as well as the Athena Parthenos. </p>

            <h4>512: Poseidon</h4>
            <p>
              Poseidon is the god of the sea and earthquakes.
              He always carries a special trident with him.
              When he is angry, he slams the trident into the ocean floor, and tsunamis erupt.
              He also uses it to water into Greece.
              Poseidon takes tile 512 because he is quite powerful but not quite at the top.

            <p>Hera is the queen of Mt. Olympus. As the dominant wife of Zeus, she is always seething with anger because of Zeus's many other wives. Hera is represented with the pomegranate and the cow.  She also is not a fan of Aphrodite because Paris decided that Aphrodite was the prettiest of the Olympians.</p>

            <h4>2048: Zeus</h4>
            <p>
              Zeus is the king and ruler of the heavens.
              As one of the sons of Kronos, he was the only one of his generation to not be eaten by his father.
              He and his siblings eventually started an uprising, and Zeus became the king.
              As an adult, he became a major polygamist.
              Because he is the most important Olympian, he is placed on the 2048 tile.
